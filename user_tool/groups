# This configuration file follows a specific structure for defining groups of system calls with parameters:
# - Arguments must be defined before groups with "a:" and "()" brackets.
# - Parameters are allowed only within groups and are specified with "p:" and "[]" brackets.
# - Each group starts with the system call number on each line and are specified with "g:" and "{}" brackets.
# - Parameters are asked sequentially. Once all arguments for a system call hit, the question is thrown.
# - If a parameter is not explicitly provided, all values for the parameter are implicitly assumed.
